There are still a few kinks being worked out, and there are still people (probably about one-third of you) for whom this site is not fully back up, but by the end of the weekend this will hopefully just be a blip on the radar screen of the complicated world of DNS propagation."}

### Test case: World War III
```
What is the World War III? Show me a diagram of why it happened.
```
```
> Entering new  chain...

Invoking: `search_engine` with `{'tool_input': 'World War III causes diagram'}`


No search results.I'm sorry, but I couldn't find a specific diagram explaining the causes of World War III. However, I can provide you with a general overview of the potential causes that could lead to a hypothetical World War III:

1. Global Power Struggles: Competition for resources, influence, and dominance among major world powers could escalate into a global conflict.

2. Territorial Disputes: Conflicts over disputed territories, such as border disputes or claims to strategic locations, could escalate and involve multiple nations.

3. Ideological Differences: Clashes between different political ideologies, such as democracy versus authoritarianism, could lead to tensions and conflicts on a global scale.

4. Nuclear Proliferation: The proliferation of nuclear weapons to more countries increases the risk of a catastrophic conflict, as the use of such weapons could have devastating consequences.

5. Cyber Warfare: Escalation in cyber attacks and cyber warfare between nations could lead to a breakdown of international relations and potentially trigger a global conflict.

6. Economic Rivalries: Intense economic competition, trade disputes, and protectionist policies could create tensions between nations and potentially escalate into a larger conflict.

It's important to note that World War III is a hypothetical scenario, and efforts are continuously made by the international community to prevent such a catastrophic event from occurring.

### Test case: Pizza

How to cook a pizza? Describe the process and the ingredients. Additionally, you can add a diagram.
```
```
> Entering new  chain...
To cook a pizza, you will need the following ingredients:

- Pizza dough
- Pizza sauce
- Cheese (mozzarella is commonly used)
- Toppings of your choice (such as pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, etc.)

Here is a step-by-step process to cook a pizza:

1. Preheat your oven to the recommended temperature (usually around 450°F or 230°C).

2. Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. You can shape it into a round, square, or any other shape you prefer.

3. Transfer the rolled-out dough onto a baking sheet or a pizza stone.

4. Spread a generous amount of pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.

5. Sprinkle a layer of cheese over the sauce. Use as much or as little cheese as you like.

6. Add your desired toppings over the cheese. Be creative and choose toppings that you enjoy.

7. Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.

8. Once the pizza is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.

Here is a diagram to visualize the process:
